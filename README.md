# Array Multiplier

Array Multiplier is a combinational circuit used for multiplying two binary numbers by employing an array of full adders and half adders. 
If we are multiplying a and b i.e., a x b,then here we can call a as multiplicand and b as multiplier. 

There are 3 steps involved in this multiplication process:
1. Partial product generation (No. of multiplier bits = No. of partial products)
1. Partial product accumulation
1. Partial product addition
